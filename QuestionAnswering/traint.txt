"how much do a long term care insurance policy cost","we have enter into a new phase of the development for cover the risk of have pay for long-term care cost and therefore a new phase of designing coverage the consumer do not have pay a fortune for at least some coverage but expectation over how much risk 1 can afford transfer to an insurance company may require some reality therapy.A base plan for a couple can cost around $3000 - $5000 per year depending on age the design be simple : a fixed pool of money with as much access to it ( maximum daily monthly benefit that 1 can afford there be no accommodation for inflation and no rider except perhaps the monthly home care rider which if not part of the contract shall be add it do not cost much as a rider the pool shall be around $300000 if possible.A value plan for a couple can cost between $5000 and $7000 per year the design include the low cost inflation rider  monthly home care rider if not include in the base plan and maybe survivor waiver of premium the pool of money pay care cost and daily monthly access to it shall be as much as can reasonably afforded.A premium plan which we use illustrate routinely 5 year ago for a couple can run from $9000 - $14000 / yr depending on which combination of bell and whistle you want and can afford this design will include 1 the automatic annual 5% compound simple benefit increase rider available rider can include share care spousal waiver of premium  0 day elimination for home care  nonforfeiture rider and/or return of premium other rider depending on the carrier may be available note : this design be most likely to experience in force premium increase over time due to the uncap benefit increase rider.For a single person drop the above range of number down $1000 for the base plan  $2000 for the value plan and $3000-$4000 for the premium plan.These be all very round number the point be column and article in the press recently have only look at the old way of thinking about long-term care it pointless to dredge up old statement by insurance company which at the time reflect their ignorance of a) how many people will actually use their policy b) how many will keep them in force if premium rose the lapse ratio 1-2% about the low in the insurance industry adjust their benefit to stay in the game c) how few people will buy long-term care insurance the percentage of American own their own coverage about 7-8% holding.The probability of need to pay or all of the cost of extend professional care at home or in a facility be still relatively high as we live long not necessarily better no LTC insurance policy can promise pay all care cost but be anyone go be turn away a payment from an insurance company that cover half those costs?Some coverage be good than none","1"

on what form you use ( blackbook value  nada  Kelly Bluebook value  etc. the form do not matter here other than answer the question of be this car worth less than the loan I have on it Erica be require have other than collision coverage often call comprehensive coverage which be a misnomer and collision coverage as a stipulation for the loan she be get with the bank or finance company that coverage state it will repair her car for specific reason in the policy or pay her the actual cash value of the car if it cost less than the repair it will take make the car driveable often a state variation will come here say a car can not be repair if the expense be 70% or more the value of the car the insurance company need pay the policyholder the actual cash value of the car instead if you look closely at your auto policy you also have a coverage protect yourself from liability cause you damage the property of other this be often refer to as property damage liability or the third number in your limit ( such as 100/300/100 limit it state it will repair the damage cause your action that you be hold responsible for or pay the actual cash value of that item if less than the cost of repair this be important  so remember it so what do this mean for Erica know this information let say Erica have have her Volkswagon Jetta for 3 year and diligently make payment on her car without miss a payment date the loan be now $9000 after interest the value of the car have depreciate down to $7600 because of the age  mileage and usage of the car technically Erica be pay $1400 more on the car than what it be worth take interest out of the equation make it easy let say at this 3 year mark  Erica get into an accident and the car be beyond repair it do not matter if she cause the accident if someone else at fault because both property damage what the other party use to fix erica car if they cause the accident collision coverage the coverage use to fix erica car if she cause the accident use actual cash value to determine how much repair will make how much money they will pay Erica both coverage will give Erica $7600 for her car however since Erica have a lien on the car because she be finance it that money actually go to the finance company and erica wont see a penny of it the finance company will apply that $7600 to her loan mean there be a $1400 balance left she be responsible for the bank not be a charity so they will still tell Erica she have pay it because it be still in her contract and the bank lose $1400 on a car that no longer exist Erica still have pay $1400 on a car she do not even have and still have buy a new car Thats a bad place be in life will not you say even worse Erica may still have make payment even if the accident be not her fault she get all of the blame of the finance company but cause none of the problem if Erica have gap insurance it will kick in at this point and relive Erica of the extra $1400 she will be responsible for if Erica be ahead of her loan and the cash value of the car be more than the loan  she will get any money pay above the loan amount thus satisfy her finance company as well and the gap insurance will not take effect either way Erica not be pay money any more on her car that be non-functional here be some common stipulation find in gap insurance check with your loan company see if they apply to you : gap insurance be there pay for the loan on the car and THATS it if you increase the loan pay for any extra you be typically not go get that part of the loan cover and will still have pay this include thing like the extend warranty  credit life insurance in case you die before the loan be pay off and thing like that it may even say the gap insurance be not pay for either and you will have pay for that its definitely worth look into gap insurance also say that it wont take effect if you be behind on your payment on a certain amount  pay more because the car be worth less from overuse or modification and wont cover intentional damage to the car basically its not there handle your loan if you be financially strap and can not handle the payment anymore and want get rid of the car another option in place of gap insurance be get the repair / replacement coverage for your auto policy this say instead of get the cash value of a car beyond repair you get a replacement car instead even if it cost more than the value of the car you will still have the loan but youd have a car as well this coverage may not be available and it often be only available for car less than 1-5 year old and only if you be the original owner talk to your agent see if you qualify gap coverage be an excellent coverage get and be worth the investment use car typically drop in value faster than the loan do from payment and you do not want be stick pay on a car you do not even have anymore","1"

"when do car insurance rate go up","I agree with Cathy but also offer 1 other major reason rate go up insurer be price a product before they know their cost it something like build a spec house for sale at $300000 with out know the purchaser be go require all hard wood floor  a finished basement and a 3 car garage have you know you will have price your product at $ 400000 this be some of the dilemma of insurer thy can look at historical outcome yet may not see a trend develop before it happen the reason most auto insurance be sell in 6 month term in the US be it often take a minimum of 1 year the carrier realize rate level on all customer in a certain state and rate filing let me give an example if company a see it need rate increase on its TX auto insurance business put that rate into effect after state approval on july 12014 it will take a full six month to raise the rate level to the new level the last customer whose policy incept on 12/31/2014.Then it take the company another 6 month to earn the premium each of those customer it have set aside some money in case you decide move your business as well as keep reserve for accident that have occur or be know be likely occur in the future.So in a full year at 7/1/2015 the company have realize the effect of its rate file in the state if it now need more fund it will take the same 12 month fully earn that premium so in effect you can see that the process of get an adequate rate an insurer loss and expect loss be at least a year on 6 month police and double that to 2 year achieve the rate level on annual policy that said recognize that your rate can go up annually in a 12 month policy because of a company filing go up as much as every 6 month an insurer who use 6 moth policies.So all that said you do not control the pricing that an aggregate need of the insurer you can better protect yourself by buy a 12 month policy lock in a rate level if you do not change the exposure ( new car or new operator and such you will have lock in rate for 1 whole year so my advice be seek out an insurer that write annual policy if available","1"
